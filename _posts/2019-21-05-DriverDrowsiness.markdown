>Creating a driver drowsiness detection system based on the work of Ghoddoosian et al [1].

The model detects drowsiness using a bi-directional LSTM. The features for the model are obtained from the eyes of the subject. The EAR (eye aspect ratio) of the subject is calculated, preprocessed and fed into the model. 

The model is implemented in Keras and Python.

This is an ongoing team project with Ganeshan Malhotra under the guidance of Dr. Sanjay Singh and Mr. Sumeet Saurav at the Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani.
