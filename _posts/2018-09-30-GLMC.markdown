 >Creating a basic replacement for GLM using *C* with a *Python* wrapper. 

The library includes functions to deal with 2D, 3D and 4D vectors. It also handles 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 matrices.
The vector library consists of the following basic vector operations:
* Normalization  
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (inplace and return)  
* Scalar multiplication and division  
* Dot product, cross product  
* Reflection, refraction  

The matrix library includes the following basic matrix operations:
* Discriminant  
* Transposition  
* Normalization  
* Addition, subtractoin, multipication and division (inplace and return)   
* Scalar multiplication and division  
* Inverse  
* Translation, rotation, scaling and identity matrices 
* Orthographic and perspective projection 
* Automatic normalization  
* Interconvertible to 1D array form  

The matrices follow column major representation in order to be compatible with OpenGL.  
The library also handles matrix-vector multiplication.

All the functions have been hard-coded and inlined to increase performance gain.

Developed for the TIP course - Intro to Open Source, conducted at BITS Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus.
