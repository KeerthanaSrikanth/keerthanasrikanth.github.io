>A study oriented project to study drug and target interactions using **network theory**.

This is an ongoing research project under the guidance of Dr. Sukanta Mondal, Assistant Professor, BITS Goa. I am working with Shruti Sridhar.

I am writing the project code in **Python** and doing network visualization in **Gephi**.
